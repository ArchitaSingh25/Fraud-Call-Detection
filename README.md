The fraud call detection system effectively identified and differentiated between legitimate and fraudulent calls using a comprehensive approach involving feature extraction, modeling, and performance evaluation. 
Key observations include:
We have seen this dataset to be 87% accurate when trained using logistic regression but when used Naive Bayes Classifier is used it increased upto 97% .
Using above accuracy, we can easily conclude how powerful and efficient is Naive Bayes Classifier in fraud detection.
We also noticed, that simply by calculating weightage of a term is not sufficient in some cases.
There is also scope of improvement in terms of detecting voice features like pitch and tone, speed and rate and many other parameters.
